Our project is to create a criminal map of Champaign, IL. Users will be able to see a google maps style map that shows crimes reported by Champaign police. When the 
API is started, a request is sent to our python backend to send the location data and criminal data for each crime on our data set. The backend then converts th
csv data of the criminal data into latitude and longitude coordinates along with the name of crime as a JSON file. This JSON file is then sent over to our front end
where we use the OpenLayers API to covert the JSON data into tags on an interactive map of Champaign, IL. A feauture we planned to add when planning the project was
an algorithm that used a predictive machine learning model to give the safest route between any two points in Champaign. Unfortunalty, this was over optimistic as we
didn't have enough time to implement this feauture. As for existing software, there are criminal maps of Champaign out there that shade in neighborhoods a certain color
depending on their frequency of crime, they don't show every individual crime on the map. Another advantage that we have is the most up to date information as we
are using Champaign police data from this year.
